	<h1>Copyright Law Helpful Facts</h1>
		<details>
			<summary>Webcasting recorded music</summary>
			<p>Webcasting recorded music is at risk of copyright strikes because most of the time the music and the actual lyrics have separate copyrights. Always be sure to have the right licenses before casting music on your website.</p>

			<summary>Just because an image is free, doesn't mean it is always free to use.</summary>
			<p>Some images come with licenses that don't allow the use of them without paying for them. To combat this, you can use fair use image sites such as Unsplash.</p>

			<summary>Color schemes can be patented.</summary>
			<p>If youre planning on competing with another company, try not to use the same color scheme as them. Companies with similar products and color schemes are at risk for copyright infringement if the other company has a patented color.</p>

			<summary>If you're recreating a site, use custom code.</summary>
			<p>You are safe from copyright infringement when recreating a site if you use custom code. Sometimes websites can have copyrighted elements, so it might not be a good idea to directly copy functions, looks, and layouts of websites.</p>

			<summary>A website as a whole cannot be copyrighted most of the time.</summary>
			<p>If you want to copyright your website as best as possible, copyright it as a collection, granted that your webpages are creative/different enough to garner a copyright.</p>
